#### [Project 1: Analysis on the Used Vehicle Price in the UK](https://github.com/k-gina/python_study/blob/main/studygroup_intermediate/analysis_on_used_vehicle_price.ipynb)
- Visaulization: used Matplotlib and Seaboarn libraries to visualise factors that have impacts on vehicle prices (such as mileage, age, make, segment).
- Pre-processed data: used Sklearn for one-hot encoding and database normalization.
- Predictive Models: built Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression models to predict the price trend of used vehicles in the UK and test the accuracy of the models.
- Outcome: Polynomial regression model built with **95.24%** accuracy (R2).
