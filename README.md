###### Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio

#### [Project 1: Analysis on the Used Vehicle Price in the UK](https://github.com/k-gina/python_study/blob/main/studygroup_intermediate/analysis_on_used_vehicle_price.ipynb)
- Visualisation: used Matplotlib and Seaboarn libraries to visualise factors that have impacts on vehicle prices (such as mileage, age, make, segment).
- Pre-processing data: used Sklearn for one-hot encoding and database normalization.
- Predictive Models: built Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression models to predict the price trend of used vehicles in the UK and test the accuracy of the models.
- Outcome: Polynomial regression model built and tested, with **95.24%** accuracy (R2). 

#### [Project 2: Analysis on Medicare Outpatient Data](https://github.com/k-gina/python_study/blob/main/studygroup_intermediate/medicare_data_analysis.ipynb)
- imported Google Cloud Data.
- Visualisation: used Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to plot bar chart for the most common outpatient conditions in the U.S. and average payments for these conditions per city.
- Pre-processing data: used Sklearn for database normalization.
- Clustering Analysis: used Sklearn to apply K-Means clustering algorithm. 
- Outcome: Two clusters are identified - the first group's average payment is 3.30 times more expensive than the second group, and the second group is 123.16 times bigger than the first group. i.e., 0.008 % of outpatient services costs more than triple compared to the rest of the services.
